# Py-neural-net

A simple neural network library written entire in python

### Current goals of the project:
- [x] Add a simple matrix data type
- [x] Add all the common functions to the matrix data type
- [x] Add basic sigmoid and relu function
- [ ] Add forward propogation
- [ ] Add backpropogation
- [ ] Add the training algorithm

### Long term goals of this project:
- [ ] Solve the XOR gate
- [ ] Solve the MNIST handwritten dataset with good accuracy
